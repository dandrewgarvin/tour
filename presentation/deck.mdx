  When we onboard a new Provider, only the person that is on the call with our
  salesperson gets a demo of the product. The rest of their users are left
  learning the system on their own. With GuideCX being such a feature-filled system,
  there will always be users that get "lost in the sauce".

# Some solutions already exist

### ...but they each come with their own flaws

---

# The "Theoretical Experience"

---

<Video src="https://i.imgur.com/HQoRA2B.mp4" />

---

### This approach has multiple problems

1. The user has still never seen the system
2. The tutorial doesn't point the user in the correct direction
3. When the tutorial ends, the user still can't use the product

---

# The "Quickly Outdated" approach

### (screenshots, video walkthrough, etc)

---

<Iframe url="https://player.vimeo.com/video/454092827" />

---

### The cons of the quickly outdated approach:

1. If the UI changes, the media is no longer accurate
2. It is expensive to maintain, and hard for users to find (sometimes)
3. Its not accessible to many user categories

But hey, harris _did_ look great in that video ðŸ˜‰

#### "Well Alex and Andrew, what the h\*ck can we do about this?"

##### - All of you

---

K fine we built a solution for this...

---

<Text style={{ color: "#666" }}>
  // TODO: insert amazing transition effect to our demo
</Text>

---

# What now?

---

With GuideCX Being a market author in the customer onboarding space,

we can now take this technology and use it as an entrypoint into maintaining open-source libraries

like the other tech companies we aspire to influence like (stripe, AirBNB, facebook, google, etc)
